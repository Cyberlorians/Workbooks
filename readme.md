*   Conditional-Access-Change-Dashboard-MAG - Workbook please review the original authors doc [here](https://danielchronlund.com/category/conditional-access/). Again, this has been modified by Cyberlorians to work in AzureUSGovernment. Thank you Daniel Chronlund for the original content. Change comparison is still in works since MAG is not 1:1 with tables/schema against its commercial counterpart.
